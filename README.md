# PricePulse — Stabilizing India's Food Basket 🚜 🇮🇳

**Theme:** Agriculture & Food Technology

---

## 🚀 Overview

PricePulse is an AI-driven **Decision Support System (DSS)** built for the Department of Consumer Affairs to move from a reactive to a proactive approach in managing price volatility for essential commodities. The system forecasts price volatility **15 days in advance** for 22 essential commodities (pulses, onions, etc.), and recommends strategic interventions.

## 🚨 Problem

Price volatility creates uncertainty for both policymakers and farmers. Current monitoring relies on delayed reporting from 550 centers — by the time a spike is detected, the market often already reacts with panic selling, inflation, and inefficient use of buffer stocks.

**Consequences**

* Panic selling by farmers
* Consumer inflation
* Wasteful or untimely use of Government Buffer Stocks

---

## 💡 Solution

PricePulse aggregates real-time and historical data, applies ML forecasting, monitors volatility, and suggests context-aware actions (release, hold, divert) using a smart buffer-stock manager.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**

  * Live heatmap of India with price hotspots across 550 reporting centers.
  * Color-coded alerts (🔴 High Volatility, 🟡 Watch, 🟢 Stable).

* **AI Forecasting (The Prophet Engine)**

  * Uses Facebook Prophet and ARIMA to produce 15-day forecasts.
  * Handles trend, seasonality (festivals), and historical patterns.

* **Smart Buffer Stock Manager**

  * Dual-trigger logic based on **Price** and **Inventory Age**.
  * Recommends releases (High Price + Fresh Stock) and diversions (Stable Price + Expiring Stock).

* **Market Intelligence Radar (NLP)**

  * Scrapes headlines (e.g., "Truck Strike", "Rains in Nashik") and performs sentiment/scenario analysis to adjust forecasts.

## 🔍 Usage & Developer Notes

* **Model file**: `price_model.pkl` — replace or re-train if you update Prophet/ARIMA hyperparameters.
* **Data ingestion**: Field officer inputs go to Firebase Realtime DB; backend pulls and aggregates into the forecasting pipeline.
* **Heatmap**: Leaflet.js reads recent prices from the backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/latest-prices`).
* **NLP scrapers**: Run cron jobs to fetch headlines and push sentiment adjustments to the ML engine.
